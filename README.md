// app.post() is like a function that listens for a specific type of request, which in this case is a POST request to the root URL ("/"). When someone submits a form on the website, this function is triggered.

// Inside the app.post() function, the submitted form data is extracted and stored in variables. The form likely asks for a first name, last name, and email address. The code takes those values and saves them in separate variables for further use.

// Now, to send this data to the Mailchimp API, the code needs to make another request. This is where the https.request() function comes in. It's like a special tool that allows the code to talk to the Mailchimp API.

// The https.request() function is called with two main things: the URL of the Mailchimp API and some options for the request. The options specify that this request is a POST request and include authentication information (a username and password) to make sure the code is authorized to communicate with the Mailchimp API.

// So, to summarize, the app.post() function handles the incoming form submission, extracts the data, and then uses the https.request() function to send that data to the Mailchimp API for further processing. They work together to make sure the form data is sent to the right place and stored in the Mailchimp mailing list.


// The https.request() function is called with three arguments:
// url: The URL of the API endpoint where the request will be sent.
// options: An object that contains additional options for the request, such as the HTTP method, authentication details, headers, etc.
// A callback function that will be executed when the response is received.

// Inside the callback function, the response object represents the response received from the API.

// The response.on("data") event is used to listen for the data received from the response. This event is triggered multiple times as the data is being received, and the callback function is executed each time.

// Within the response.on("data") callback, the received data is processed. In the provided code, JSON.parse(data) is used to parse the received data, assuming it is in JSON format. The parsed data can then be used or further processed as needed.



// after setting up the request and response handlers, the request.write(jsonData) line is called. This writes the jsonData (which is a serialized JSON string) to the request body. In the case of making a POST request, the request body typically contains the data being sent to the server. Here, jsonData is the subscriber information in JSON format, which will be sent to the Mailchimp API.
